# Time Series Analysis

The analysis of time series has taken many forms. One can do time series analysis in the time domain, or in the frequency domain: ARIMA methods in the time domain or spectral analysis in the frequency domain. Fourier series harmonic analysis is time series analysis in the frequency domain.
